# COMP247-Project

Hello group4 members,
- I added a branch for each of us to have a work space to doing part2 (data modelling), so we can assist each other more easily without having to send our files on whatsapp.
- It's not strictly necessary to join and contribute to the github repo, this was mainly for me to have my part1 files be easily accesible to everyone without having to open any IDE, you can simply copy from the files and I'll notify everyone if any changes are made to the files.
- With that being said, I have updated part1 so that ACCNUM is properly corrected, and also filled in the remaining columns with null values, so the modified dataset should be complete with about 9.4k rows and 40ish columns.
- Only the jupyter is updated, I will try to have the equivalent version as .py file at a later time.
- The sections are better organized with clearer labels and comments.
- I've disabled the plots for now so that running the program doesn't waste so much time. I already know they work even with the changes.
- The one thing I might need help on is my Part 2. I'm not sure if I didn't the Chi-square scoring correctly. 'HOOD-140' has a really large score and I don't know if I should remove it or keep it.
